# Time-Series-Textbooks
This time series textbook repository aims to cover the 20 areas listed below. I started building this repository on 30 August 2023; it is a work in progress. 

1. **Introduction to Time Series**
   - Definition and examples
   - Components of time series: trend, seasonality, cyclical, and noise

2. **Time Series Visualization**
   - Time plots
   - Seasonal decomposition

3. **Stationarity**
   - Definition and importance
   - Dickey-Fuller test

4. **Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation**
   - ACF and PACF plots

5. **Moving Averages**
   - Simple, weighted, and exponential

6. **Smoothing Techniques**
   - Holt-Winters
   - Exponential smoothing

7. **Decomposition Methods**
   - Additive and multiplicative models

8. **Linear Time Series Models**
   - AR (AutoRegressive)
   - MA (Moving Average)
   - ARMA (AutoRegressive Moving Average)
   - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

9. **Seasonal Models**
   - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)

10. **Model Identification**
   - Selecting the order of differencing
   - Identifying the order of AR or MA terms

11. **Model Estimation**
   - Maximum likelihood estimation

   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

15. **Model Selection**
   - Information Criteria: AIC, BIC

16. **Multivariate Time Series**
   - Vector autoregressive models (VAR)

17. **ARCH and GARCH Models**
   - For modeling volatility

18. **Intervention Analysis**
   - Identifying and modeling outliers

19. **Machine Learning for Time Series**
   - Regression trees and Random Forest
